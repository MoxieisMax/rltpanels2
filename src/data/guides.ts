    lastUpdated: '19/04/26',
    content: `The most common wavelengths in red light therapy are 660nm and 850nm. 
    **660nm (Visible Red)** is mostly absorbed by the skin tissue, making it the primary choice for collagen production, acne, and anti-aging.
    **850nm (Near-Infrared)** is invisible to the human eye and penetrates much deeper into the body—reaching muscles, nerves, and even bone to reduce inflammation.`,

    lastUpdated: '19/04/26',
    content: `Handheld devices are great for travel, but they lack the **irradiance** (power density) of a tabletop panel. If you are serious about treating systemic inflammation or back pain, a panel is almost always the better long-term investment.`,
